Selenium-Maven-Template
=======================

A maven template for Selenium that has the latest dependencies so that you can just check out and start writing tests.

Check out this project.

In the terminal

cd *project_directory*
mvn clean install -U

All dependencies should now be downloaded and the example test will be run (Assuming you have Firefox installed in the default location)
